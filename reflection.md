- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Mata & Nura (they are from other section but we live in the same dorm)
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I couldnt go this week
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
i have taken java before and i still i like over python
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
they are both hard but have different functions which reflects on how different the both languages are. they still both could achieve the same results.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This code was on the longer side so there are alot of bugs and the more you spend time on experimenting on it the more you forgot what you need to keep vs what you were just trying to see. my advise would be keep track of the changes you make since you often would want to look back and compare.
